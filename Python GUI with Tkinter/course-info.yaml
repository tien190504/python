title: Python GUI with Tkinter
language: English
summary: "This course offers learning materials for students interested in developing\
  \ cross-platform desktop applications with Python’s built-in Tkinter module. The\
  \ course includes two sections going from basic to intermediate, each with a range\
  \ of examples and exercises on building apps with buttons, data entry widgets, and\
  \ menus. These exercises guide you through the development of a strategy game with\
  \ a computer opponent (that doesn’t cheat!) and a simple drawing app. Examples and\
  \ exercises include using layouts, frames, buttons, data entry, binding, menus (submenus\
  \ and popup), canvas (and canvas shapes), scale, spinbox, radio button, check and\
  \ message box."
