# Interactive Drawing

## Your Task
- Place a canvas widget in the window.
- Bind the input event to the `draw_with_brush` function so that pressing the left mouse button draws on the canvas.
- Complete the `draw_with_brush` function by making it draw an oval.

## What is this all about?
In this lesson, we created a program that allows the user to draw on the window with a brush tool.

There are a lot of widgets that you can apply to your program.
* You could add radio buttons, 
* Or use a tear off menu as a colour selector.

Why not research some of these ideas by yourself? Aa there are a lot of interesting programs that you are now capable of creating.

    Lesson '1.2.2 Layouts' in the '1. Basic - GUI with Tkinter' section is probably the right "place" to start looking for help.
